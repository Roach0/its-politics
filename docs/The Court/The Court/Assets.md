- These are read by [[Office]] to generate [[Scoring|points]] at the end of a [[round]].
- These act as a bus for player [[scoring]], as having a character with assets on a [[Office|position]] that scores those assets highly is key to winning.
- Assets are scored an read on two different levels:
	- As a Type
		- Some cards and positions will specifically interact with certain assets by their type.
	- As a Unique Asset
		- Some cards and positions will specifically interact with certain assets by name.

- Players will focus on removing, adding and empowering these assets on character to hinder point gains of other players, while maximizing their own.


- Assets also determine what player scores.  Since multiple people may score from a single official, when an asset is added to a character, the asset is also linked to the player, and they gain any points specific to that assets generation.
- So each asset is what's really being scored for the player.
- Assets that spawn from the pool when the character is generated, are automatically assigned to the player that spawned the official.
