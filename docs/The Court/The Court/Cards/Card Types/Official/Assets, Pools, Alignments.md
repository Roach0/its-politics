### Breakdown
- Assets Overview
- Alignment System
- Coup Conditions
#### Assets
- Assets are a type of token granted by the player, collected on officials, and used in asset scoring and card effects. 
- Cards that are played on officials will always add an asset to the official it's played on.  Officials will spawn with one each of the combination of it's focus / types.
- What type of assets are spawned are determined by the Alignment of the card being played.
- Assets also determine what player scores.  Since multiple people may score from a single official, when an asset is added to a character, the asset is also linked to the player, and they gain any points specific to that assets generation.

#### Alignment
- Alignment is used in the scoring process to match with cards played on them.
- Alignments really represents what asset(s) will be spawned on an official when 'this' card is played.  A card with the alignment of Wealth, will spawn a wealth asset.
