Players have one real interaction with the board, card placement, and two main ways to do so.

- Card Play - Limited to three, but players only begin with a single play token.  Initiated when a card is played anywhere in the government area.
	- A play token is used each time a player does a "Card Play" in their turn.
- Liquidation - Unlimited, this action removes the card and attributes it's "Play Cost" to the economy panel resources.  The players play tokens will also be checked, and if able, it will add a play token to the player.
