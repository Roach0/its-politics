Points & Scoring

Points are the win condition for players.  They are set to a threshold.  Once this threshold is met, the player with the highest score will win.  This will ensure that even if multiple players pass the threshold, a winner single will still be determined.

- Coup Conditions are activated after the players turn, if an official with a Coup Condition fulfills their requirements and are scored, their coup pays out and the government is changed to the corresponding government type indicated in the coup condition statement.

		- (in progress)

#### Card Play Effect
- Some cards, when played, will include awarding points in their card effect.  This is dependent only on the card effect and whatever it points to.  It is acted out in the same step as all card effects.
