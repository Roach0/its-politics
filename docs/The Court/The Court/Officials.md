- Characters which occupy [[Office]].
- Characters differ in that they spawn with a different [[Asset Pool]] available to generate on them.
- These assets are the only real difference between characters while on the board.
- Each character has a [[TTP]] (Time to play),  to ensure no character can rest on the board forever, all character spawn with a countdown timer before they pass away of natural causes.
