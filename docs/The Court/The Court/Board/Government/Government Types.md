- Each government has 5 positions.
- 1 position is always a 'top' position, which gives high bonuses.
- The types of positions may change for certain spots.
- Each government has a flow pattern, so when a position is opened, adjacent officials will fill that spot and shift the positions of other officials in turn.
 
 Positions are represented squares with arrows between them that denote the flow firection.  Not all positions have a flow arrow.  Some positions can only filled via playing an Official Card on them.

refer to the canvas model to see how these postions work in each government type.
