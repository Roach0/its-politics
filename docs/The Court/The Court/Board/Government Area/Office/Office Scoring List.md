Positions define the shape of the game board.  Their flow hierarchy determines how officials behave when there are open positions.

- Name
- Scoring
- Flow & Position


**Flow Mechanic** - When a position is empty, it may have a position flow leading to it from another position.  IF that other position is filled, the official filling it will shift over when a card is played, as long as the played card is not an official being played
