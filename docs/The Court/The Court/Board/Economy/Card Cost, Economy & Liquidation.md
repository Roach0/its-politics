#### Breakdown
- The Economy is a shared resource pool.  When any card is played, it requires a combination of economy resources.

#### Economy Resources:
- There are 3 Economy Resource Types:  The Max for each is 100,  the crisis threshold for each is 30.
	- Health
	- Food
	- Wealth
- The Economy Panel displays the 3 Economy Resource Types, this system directly reflects the Asset Types system, as both are projected onto other systems to generate combinations and provide inherent tie-ins.  The goal is to make every choice multiply feedback for the player.

#### Office Focus:
- The Office System contributes to the Economy System through their Economy Focus attribute.  During scoring, any occupied offices will contribute to their corresponding focus, depending on their occupying official.

#### Card Cost
- Each card, when being played into the government area, will have an associate card cost.  This is a list of 1-3 economy resources which must be drawn from the economy in order to put into play.

#### Crisis
- Each resource has a threshold to indicate when they've dipped into a crisis level.
- A few things happen:
	- When any resource is in crisis, it's card costs are halved.  Meaning any card cost with that resource is halved.
	- Resources other than the one in crisis have their costs doubled.  It's the inverse of the above.
	- Any Official occupying an office with the same focus as a resource in crisis, will have their death timer reduced by 2 instead of 1 with each card play, and will be excluded from scoring until out of crisis.

#### Liquidation
- Dragging a card onto the economy panel will liquidate the card.  This adds it's cost in resources to the economy, and also provides the player with a play token if they have not already received 2.
- A play token allows the player the play a card in the government area.  If a player runs out of play tokens, and have already received 2 play tokens.
